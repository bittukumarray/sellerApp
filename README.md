# SellerApp

Below I have listed all the details to run this project.

- Go to the root directory - that is in the sellerApp directory and there type the below command to build and run the containers

  - ```dockerfile
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

- Now all the three containers will be running, so you just have to open the postman and send a POST request on 

  ```
  http://localhost:8000/crawl
  ```

   with body input in JSON format as

  ```json
  {"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SH57BCY/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pd_rd_i=B07SH57BCY&pd_rd_w=rv6Ca&pf_rd_p=5d846283-ed3e-4512-a744-a30f97c5d738&pd_rd_wg=8k0DC&pf_rd_r=KC781B3KTG8VCBG19X5B&pd_rd_r=7164a4eb-2476-4fd0-ae10-507244a0948c&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExUTA5WENQVjQ4WlJUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDQwMTg1MTdMNFFMUENJSk0xUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDM4MDUxMUxBVlA1UllCRUFYQSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2RldGFpbF90aGVtYXRpYyZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU="}
  ```

- The request will be sent to the fetcher service and after crawling data the fetcher service further calls to the data writer service which writes the product details into mongodb database.

- The Ouput format will be

  ```json
